I am imagining a neural band where all the instruments are controlled through the brain. Each player has an implant. There are four players. The players sit on a stage in a packed club. They are crosslegged, in a row facing the crowd, with their eyes closed. 

The music is not quiet. It is blasting. The crowd is not quiet either - they are on dancing, drinking, partying hard.

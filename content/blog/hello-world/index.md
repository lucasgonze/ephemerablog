description: "An ephemeral blog only ever has one post"
---

Hello, and welcome to the first post on my ephemeral blog!  How exciting! I suppose I should make it good. 

This page has minimal ego. Or maybe a lot, but in a humblest-person-ever way.

It occurred to me that there should exist, and could exist, a blog with one little post. Just one. But it would not stay the same.

Not a reverse-chronological feed. Just a single thing. You have finally reached the end of the Internet. No, not [there](http://hmpg.net/ "there"). 

No archive. No memory. Just a thing that changes. 

Someday I will update this, though you will almost certainly not see it.

I don't plan to publish regularly. I am not seeking to become an influencer. This is not a social network. This is not a part of my personal brand. It is more like a loud monologue in an otherwise-quiet spot in the woods.

 You could come back but you won't, except by accident. Goodbye. I hope you enjoy the rest of the Internet. ðŸ‘‹
